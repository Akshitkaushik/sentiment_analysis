**Subject: Talcott DMF Bot Enhancement – Update and Scheduling Request**

Hello Team,

I would like to share an important update regarding the recent enhancement request for the Talcott DMF bot.

We recently received a request to enhance the bot, which was initially designed to work only with the IN03 database. The requirement was to include two additional databases – IN04 and IS02 – in the process.

I’m happy to inform you that we have completed the development and UAT testing for this enhancement. All relevant approvals and the enhancement request email have been attached for your reference. The updated code has also been successfully imported into the production environment – thank you all for your support in making this happen.

### Summary of Changes in the Updated Code:
- **Original Setup:** Previously, the bot was configured to process a single database file – **IN03**.
- **Updated Setup:**
  - We have now included support for **IN04** and **IS02** databases.
  - The **S3 path locations** for all three files have been updated. Below are the details of the new S3 locations for each database file:
    1. S3 location for IN03
    2. S3 location for IN04
    3. S3 location for IS02

Additionally, we have introduced **two more bot runners** to handle this process more efficiently. The details of the new bot runner VDIs and their corresponding bot IDs, along with the database names they are associated with, are mentioned below:
- [VDI & Bot ID for IN04]
- [VDI & Bot ID for IS02]

With this enhancement, the Talcott DMF bot will now handle **three separate files**, each associated with a unique S3 path. We have also created subfolders within the S3 structure based on the database file names, and we will continue to receive these files from the EBSI team accordingly.

### Request for Scheduling:
I kindly request you to schedule the Talcott DMF bot to run on the **two new bot runners** at the **same scheduled time** as the existing bot runner.

- **Current Machine & Bot ID:** [Details]
- **Current Schedule Time:** [Time]
- **New Machines to be Scheduled:** [VDI Names]

Lastly, I have updated the **runbook** and the relevant **Confluence page** to reflect all these changes for future reference.

Please let me know once the scheduling is done or if you need any further information.

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
