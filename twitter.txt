Request for Validation of Test Results Based on Updated Input Sheet

Dear Team,

Thank you for sharing the input file. As per your updated requirements, I have completed the testing using the provided input sheet.

Since I could not find any values greater than 16:00 in the "Post Time" column, I added a few sample entries above this threshold for testing purposes. I have highlighted the rows with post times greater than 16:00 in the attached result file for your reference.

Kindly review the attached file and validate the results. Please let me know if the output meets your expectations, and feel free to share any feedback or suggestions.

Looking forward to your response.
