Dear Tony,

I hope this message finds you well.

I’m reaching out regarding the two tickets we recently raised for the new bot IDs SAAP221 and SAAP222.

The bot ID SAAP222 has access to both IN04 UAT and PROD environments, and it is functioning correctly across both.

However, I’m facing an issue with SAAP221, which is configured to work with the IS02 database. While it is working fine in the UAT environment, I’m encountering an error when attempting to access the PROD database. I’ve attached the error details for your reference.

Could you kindly look into this at your earliest convenience? The bot is scheduled to run tomorrow, so a quick resolution would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for your support.
