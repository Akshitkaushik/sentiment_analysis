Hello Chrish,

I have a small request. I understand Taufique has already validated the failure records in EASY, but if you get some time, could you please revalidate them from your end as well? Kindly review all conditions on the data — last time, a similar issue was due to missing information in the PASV or EASY database.

Meanwhile, I’m also checking with Neeta on the failure records.

Thank you!
