Hello Khan,

Thank you for sharing the PPTs. I will proceed with testing my bot.

I have one more requestâ€”would it be possible to receive these PPTs within the input file? If Jyothilaxmi extracts the PPTs and shares them in the S3 location, I will be able to test my bot end-to-end, from downloading the input file to updating the data via the API.

If this is feasible, could you please share the data inside the input file in the S3 path? Let me know your thoughts.
