Iâ€™m currently working on the enhancement request related to the PSC email. In order to proceed, I would need to export the latest version of the code from the production environment. For that, I kindly request your approval so that the support team can share the most recent production code with me.

Once I receive it, I will begin testing and implementing the required changes as per the new requirements.

Thank you for your support.
