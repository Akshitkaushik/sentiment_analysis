Thank you for your response.

I would like to provide an update regarding the issue. As per the Service Desk team, the password for the EASY bot ID was reset yesterday. Since then, I am unable to log in using the old passwordâ€”only the new password provided by the Service Desk is working.

The Service Desk team has informed me that the IAM team will handle this issue going forward. I have also attached the relevant ticket comments in the email below for your reference.

Kindly assist in resolving this issue at the earliest. Please let me know if any additional information or action is required from my side.

Thank you for your support.
