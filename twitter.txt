Hi Chrish,

I spoke with Jyothilaxmi last Friday about the MTR failure. Based on my testing, it seems the issue is related to the term date. If a participant's term date is after the bot run date, the API is unable to unenroll them.

For example, one participant had a term date of July 8th. When I ran the bot on July 5th, it worked fine. But when I tested again after July 8th, the API failed with the same error.

So I’m wondering — how is the term date determined? And should we avoid sending unenrollment requests if the term date is before or equal to the bot run date?

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Akshit
