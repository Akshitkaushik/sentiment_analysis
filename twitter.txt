I would like to suggest a streamlined approach using Power Automate to manage form submissions and daily file handling efficiently.

Currently, when a user fills out and submits the form, their details are automatically added as a new row in the Excel file — this is already handled via Power Automate.

To further enhance this process, here's what we propose:

Daily File Creation: Power Automate will create a new Excel file every day in a SharePoint folder. This file will store all the form submissions received on that specific day.

Automated File Sharing: Once the file is populated with the day's data, Power Automate will automatically send it to our team for further processing.

Data Review & Status Update: We will review the data, perform our necessary steps, and update each entry with a "Status" column as required.

Return & Upload: After processing, we will return the updated file to you. You can then upload it to a separate SharePoint folder 
Dear Team,

Thank you so much for your validation and the detailed observations shared.

Based on the current findings, I would kindly suggest reviewing the logic used during data preparation or extraction (particularly within the bot or RPA process). It may be helpful to ensure that only valid participants — whose agreements are appropriately terminated — are included in the data being passed to the API.



Thank you for the validation and helpful observations.

If I’m not mistaken, it seems that the logic related to termed participant agreement dates may need to be reviewed — specifically in the data fetching or extraction part.
Just to clarify: would this be something the EBSI team needs to review and update on their end?

I wanted to confirm this understanding before proceeding further. Please let me know your thoughts whenever convenient.







This small check could help maintain consistency and prevent unintended unenrollments in similar cases moving forward.
