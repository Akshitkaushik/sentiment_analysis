esterday, I checked with Taufique regarding the BSS project walkthrough call. He mentioned that he is currently working on the requirements. Recently, Cheryl sent an email with a few updates, and once he receives the final version, he will schedule the walkthrough call with the RPA team—likely within the next week or two.

In the meantime, if there's any other task that I can assist with, please feel free to assign it to me. I’ll be happy to start working on it."
