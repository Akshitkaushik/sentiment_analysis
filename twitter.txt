Goal: 
Empower Advisory Group (EAG) would like to implement an automated process to identify and unenroll deceased participants enrolled in My Total Retirement (MTR) and send a letter to the estate/beneficiary notifying them of the unenrollment.  This will eliminate potentially unnecessary charges to the beneficiaries and allow them to direct the investments as they choose from either of the 3 managed account offerings: (help me do it, do it for me, do it myself).

Current Process Description: 
Currently there is no operational/automated process to unenroll deceased participants from My Total Retirement (MTR), Empower Advisory Group’s (EAG) managed account service.  Fees continue to be assessed and charged to the account(s) and the investments continue to be managed according to the deceased participant’s investment objectives. If a beneficiary wishes to unenroll the deceased participant’s account from MTR, they must first confirm that they are the beneficiary on the account and authorized to act on the account, and then make a positive election to unenroll using a call service. This may be before or after additional fees have been charged or transactions are processed following the death of the account holder.

Future Process Description: 
Query EASY using criteria below to identify and automate the unenrollment process for deceased participants enrolled in My Total Retirement (MTR). Then, send a letter to the estate/beneficiary notifying them of the unenrollment.

Frequency: 
First day of every month (dated as of last day of the month)





Goal: 
Offer online enrollment to the State of Iowa state employees; generate a report identifying which ppts have enrolled online the previous day. Then, send an email notification to those ppts.

Current Process Description: 
All enrollments for the State of Iowa are done with a paper form. 
New hire receives the form via the advisor or state web site, completes the form, then submits to Empower to process. Empower is not the deferral record keeper. This is all done by the Money-In Team using EASY forms. 
The State of Iowa requires an advisor to be assigned to each new enrollment. If the new hire is meeting with an advisor while they complete the paper enrollment form, the advisor will add their information to the form. If the new hire is not meeting with an advisor, the Money-In team will add the “default” advisor listed in the Comp Screen in EASY to the new hire’s account during the processing steps. Participant can change advisor at any time by completing a paper form and sending it to Empower. 
Current online functionality does not allow participants to elect a specific advisor via the current process. 

Future Process Description: 
Proposed Online Enrollment process: 
•	New participant uses Plan Enrollment Code (PEC) to enroll
o	During enrollment, advisor section will be assigned an ADV XXXX versus a specific advisor name through the Comp Screen in EASY which feeds to the Subset Screen
•	Participant will elect deferral through employer portal – Empower is not the deferral recordkeeper for the State of Iowa
•	BOT process
o	Assign the current default advisor to the participant account post enrollment from the Comp Screen in EASY; default advisors rotate quarterly, CSM process
o	Send email notification to participant re: State of Iowa.ppt communication.post enrollment_final file_0403.pdf
o	Criteria for report 
	Enrolled online via PEC
	Participant subset is ADV XXXX
	Participant name, email address, mailing address
There will be an email notification to the participant to notify them of the advisor assigned to their account. The participant can change the advisor at any time via paper form. 

Frequency: Daily






Overview of the bot:

Talcott DMF bot process automation is to automate the process of identifying the population, transmitting a bulk file to LexusNexus to get current information, receiving the bulk file back from LexusNexus, updating date of death in EASY, cancelling PIN and adding restrictions, and then opening an SR to the plan’s CSM for plan notification and future handling.

 
NOTE: Talcott DMF bot is working with 3 databases IN03,IN04,IS02]  - 

S3 path:

\\pawsstgl01\workflow-hta\HTA\Empower\TalcottDMF_1577\IN04

\\pawsstgl01\workflow-hta\HTA\Empower\TalcottDMF_1577\IN03

\\pawsstgl01\workflow-hta\HTA\Empower\TalcottDMF_1577\IS02

 

EBSI queries EASY to produce LexusNexus Intake File
EBSI places intake file in Out Files folder for the Move It Team
Move It Team sends file to LexusNexus
Move it Team retrieves file from LexusNexus and places it in the In files folder
EBSI changes column headers and places file in S3 location
RPA grabs file from S3 location and reviews confidence criteria from LN
If record passes Confidence Criteria, RPA will update DOD, add a narrative, and either:
Open an SR to BSS for each participant
Open an SR to Triage for each plan
If record does not pass confidence criteria, RPA will open an SR to BSS for each participant
Bot Flow:

 Bot downloads input from S3
 Add the columns "Bot Status for EASY update", "Bot Status for SR update", "Bot Comments", "ID" and fill the series in ID column which refers the record number
 Bot validates confidence criteria if column X "verify_best_ssn=100%" and "verify_best_dob=100%" and "verify_best_name>=90". If the condition satisfies then
Login into EASY, selects the DB and Enter into QYPA screen
Click on INER button→ enter the IND_ID → Press F5 and EXIT
Enter death date and update death date indicator to "Y" → Press F6 to save and update column "Bot Status for Easy update" as "Pass"
Check the column C "Exception Plan", if the column value is "Exception Process"
Create participant level SR to BSS and update the column "Bot Status to SR update" as "Pass"
Else check if plannumber.xlsx is present in the input path
If file is present then add the record to the excel and update the column "Bot Status to SR update" as "Added"
else create an excel file with name as (PlanNumber).xlsx then add the record to the excel and update the column "Bot Status to SR update" as "Added"
If confidence criteria does not satisfied then update the column "Bot Status for Easy update" as "Fail" and Create participant level SR to BSS and update the column "Bot Status to SR update" as "Pass"
Continue step 3.a to 4 for all records. Once all records are completed, proceed from 1st record
Check if "Bot Status for SR update" column value is 
If it is "Added" then check if the plan is under restricted 
If restricted, Create a Plan level SR to Triage, attach the plannumber.xlsx to the SR and change the owner to "CSG - US Triage Team"
If it is not restricted, then create a plan level SR to Triage, attach the plannumber.xlsx to SR.
Validations while creating Plan level SR:

Once SR is created, create a text file with plannumber.txt in the TriagePlans folder inside input path
Get the SR number and update it in SRNumber column→ status column will be updated as "SRCreated"
If SR is created and files are attached then plannumber_fileattached.txt file will be created→ status column will be updated as "FileAttached"
If SR is created for restricted plan, file attached then plannumber_fileattached.txt will be created→ status column will be updated as "FileAttached_Res"
If SR created, file attached & ownership changed then plannumber_Success.txt will be created→ status column will be updated as "Pass"
In case of failure, rerun the bot. Bot will run from where it left. No manual intervention is required.

LN Confidence Step Logic Notes 

SSN = Column X = “Verify_best_ssn” 

The score of the best SSN based on LexID match vs Input:  

100% = Exact match 

90% = 1 digit off 

80% = 2 off, etc.  

255 = Blank on one side or the other (could not compare). 

Name 

The score of the best SSN based on LexID match vs Input:  

100% = Exact match 

90% =??? 

DOB 

The score of the best DOB based on LexID match vs Input:  

100% = Exact Match 

80% = Month/Year Match or Month/Day,  

40% = typically year only match.  

255 = Blank on one side or the other (could not compare). 

 

 

 

 

 

RPA/Bot Actions: 

High Level Summary: 

Check if record passes Confidence Criteria  

Criteria for Pass: 

SSN = Column X = verify_best_ssn = 100% 

DOB = Column W = verify_best_dob = 100% 

Name = Column V = verify_best_name >= 90% 

Criteria For Fail: 

Anything that does not pass above criteria 

IF record passes Criteria THEN update DOD, Change Death Field to Y, Add Narrative to EASY, and Open SR or Email Triage 

Add DOD First. If DOD does not update then flag as a failure on our audit report and do not continue with narrative and SR process. 

Update Participant Record in EASY with DOD 

DOD = Column P  

Change Death Field IND to Y 

Graphical user interface, text, application

Description automatically generated, Picture 

Add Narrative to Participant Account – 

“DOD added due to Lexis/Nexis search. If participant calls and passes enhanced verification, open an SR to BSS requesting the DOD and DTHN restriction be removed and PIN changed to U. Participant should be referred to Lexis/Nexis to clear their record with them.” 

Open SR  

Check for “Exception Process” Plan in Column C  

IF Value = “Exception Process” THEN Open SR to BSS 2.0 Exception @ Participant Level 

ELSE SR to Triage @ Plan Level 

Each SR will need to be opened under it’s own Plan. 

Each SR will need a spreadsheet attached that contains all participants of that plan on our input file. 

Example: If Plan 123456-01 has 5 participants, then a spreadsheet with all 5 participant records will need to be included. 

IF Record does NOT pass Criteria – Open SR to BSS 2.0 Confidence @ Participant Level
