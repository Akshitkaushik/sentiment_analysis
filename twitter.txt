That said, I would also appreciate it if you could set up a quick call with me — and if possible, include Tom in the discussion as well. Since I’ve been following the shared RPA steps (reading data from the input file and passing the individual number, plan number, and database to the API), and the error still appears, it would be helpful to validate this from Tom’s side too — especially considering he may have access to the ElasticSearch logs.
