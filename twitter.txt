Subject: Request for Code Review Approval – Talcott DMF Bot

Hello Karthiga,

Could you please provide your code review approval for the Talcott DMF bot?

Below are the recent changes made to the TaskBot:

Talcott Master Code – Updated the file name in line 8 with the database name.
Talcott Update Easy – Replaced the IN03 static database value with a dynamic variable.
Individual Query – Integrated the current POP handle code within the existing IF condition.
Config File Update – Updated the S3 path and added a new node for the database name.
Once the production machine is ready, I will perform one more round of end-to-end testing in the production environment.



Could you please share some production dummy PPTS data for my testing in the production environment, covering all three databases? I want to ensure everything runs smoothly before the March 28 code freeze, which will last until April 11.

As you know, during this period, no code changes can be made in production. To avoid any issues, I would like to complete the testing in advance. Your support in providing the required data would be greatly appreciated.
