I hope you’ve seen Taufique’s email regarding the MTR process. Since Tom has retired, I wanted to check if there’s a replacement for him, so I can follow up accordingly.

We’re currently facing some issues with the MTR API process. Previously, Tom had shared certain API endpoints, and I’m now encountering errors with some records. I’d like to validate whether those records are still working on your end, possibly through Postman or any internal tools.

Please let me know how to proceed or whom I can coordinate with.
