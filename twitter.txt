Subject: Update on Loan ACH Empower Email Template Configuration

Hi Team,

Just a quick update — I’ve made some changes to the email templates for the Loan ACH Empower & Branding project. These are only template-level updates.

Since we’re currently using an additional machine for Loan ACH Empower, I’ve updated the config file (LapCH_ACH_Empower) accordingly. Please make sure to use this new config file when working from the additional machine.
