Hello Rob,

I hope you're doing well.

As you know, Taufique is on leave until May 5th. I just wanted to check if there is anyone else available for the BSS process who can share the RPA requirements and provide the necessary details during his absence.

Taufique had informed me last Friday that he is currently supporting the EBSI process, and once he's back from leave, he will share confirmation on the BSS RPA steps. In the meantime, it would be helpful if someone else could assist with the information.

Looking forward to your guidance.
