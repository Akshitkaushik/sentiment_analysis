Hi Khan,

I believe this might still be a record issue, although I’m not entirely sure. Could you please validate the failure record one more time?

As the error message indicates:

“No account to enroll were provided for the user” – This typically means the bot didn’t receive any valid account details to process the enrollment, possibly due to missing or incorrect input data.

I’ve already checked my code and re-ran the failure records individually, but I’m still getting the same error. Kindly validate these records in EASY once again. If needed, please feel free to set up a call with the team so we can review this together.

Looking forward to your availability so we can resolve this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
