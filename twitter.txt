Hello Harrishon,

I have completed the UAT testing for the additional bot component in the Talcott DMF bot. I have attached the test results in this email for your review.

Could you please provide your approval to move the code to the production environment?

Thank you.


Hello @Kahn and Chris,

As you know, we have completed both production and UAT testing. Before the go-live, I need your approval to proceed, as the bot is working as expected.

Note: Just a reminder that the code freeze will be in effect from March 28 to April 11, during which no changes can be made to the bot process.

Looking forward to your approval.

Thank you.
