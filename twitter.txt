Iâ€™m using this network drive for one of the upcoming processes. I raised a ticket and can now access the path, but I'm unable to open it in the Dev and UAT environments. Since this seems to be a Prod path, as Harish mentioned, I need to check with you regarding access for lower environments like Dev and UAT.
