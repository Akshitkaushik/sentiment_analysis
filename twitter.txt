I will focus on completing upcoming automation projects such as BSS Deceased and Bulletin Posting before the deadline.

These projects are currently in the requirement phase, and I am attending meetings with the business team to understand the process and prepare documentation.

I aim to automate more complex processes using REST API integrations and advanced logic.

I will support the maintenance and enhancement of existing bots to improve efficiency and ensure long-term stability.

I am actively learning and exploring Gen AI and document understanding to apply in future automation initiatives.

I plan to enhance my expertise in Power Automate, n8n, ChatGPT, and other AI-driven automation tools.

I seek more exposure to cross-functional processes, system architecture, and security compliance especially while working with third-party tools.

I may require support in the form of timely access to business credentials, process documentation, and collaboration with SMEs.

My overall goal is to grow technically and strategically while contributing meaningfully to Empowerâ€™s automation roadmap.
