Procedures for Working the BSS Trailing Dividend/Contribution Report 

Overview
•	BSS Trailing Dividend/Contribution Report – provides a list of all participant accounts with a date of death, ownership agreement code of ‘N’ that had an account balance, then went down to zero after a full withdrawal and then had a positive account balance in any account fund. It includes the following data points:

o	GA_ID
o	IND_ID
o	Bene First and Last Name, BENE_SSN and BENE_SSN_EXT listed in EASY records and their Bene_Percent. (Entitlement) 
o	
•	Bene Claims has placed the following manual process in place to research and process distributions as needed for each confirmed trailing dividend or contribution.

Procedures
Details: Each morning the gatekeeper (manager) will update the spreadsheet by processor with research items to complete. During research the processor will review each line item (case seems like jargon) assigned to them and confirm if the amount is a trailing contribution/dividend in the decedent account. If yes, the processor will update the spreadsheet to indicate the balance is Residual and if it Needs Transfer by the segregation team.

Steps to confirm if account balance is residual: 
1.	Enter the deceased participant's SSN in EASY (CABL) to start researching.
2.	Confirm if the balance in the account is a residual/trailing contribution by reviewing the following: 
a.	Review any death claim processed in the disbursement summary screen.
b.	Confirm in the QDRO/DEATH tab if segregation has processed to a beneficiary takeover account. 
c.	Using EASY(CABL) review the beneficiary takeover account and notate on the spreadsheet if a full w/d was processed previously by adding the Original Dist EID and Date of Original Dist.
d.	There may be a situation where the bene just elected to establish an account and let the $ sit under their takeover account, in this case, we still need to transfer the trailing into their bene account, but no distribution should be done. 
3.	If neither 1 nor 2 is satisfied, the balance is still waiting to be claimed and cannot be considered as residual or trailing contribution. Update the spreadsheet to indicate it is not a Residual and does not need to be transferred.

4.	If Step 2a is confirmed, then process the death claim residual by copying the original full w/d event that was processed under the deceased or beneficiary account.
a.	If the original distribution has been more than 2 years AND the Beneficiary is older than 65, we must review Lexis Nexis to confirm they are not decrease prior to processing the trailing.  If the beneficiary is documented as deceased, we will leave the funds in the account. Update the spreadsheet is Bene is Deceased per Lexis Nexis and add the following Narrative: DO NOT SEND TRAILING CONTRIBUTIONS TO BENEFICIARY XXXXXXXXXXXXX, HE IS DECEASED PER LEXIS NEXIS.
b.	 If the beneficiary is not documented in Lexis Nexis as deceased, please move forward with the payout.
c.	Complete the spreadsheet with the Original Dist EID, Date of Original Dist and the new Event Processed (Future Date) EID.
d.	The assigned reviewer will review and authorize the transaction.
5.	If step 2b is confirmed, then proceed per below: 
a.	Complete the spreadsheet columns to indicate that it is a Residual and that it Needs Transfer.
b.	Once segregations have completed the transfer and provided the Transfer EID the processor may proceed with the Day 2 process.		
6.	You may stop here and proceed to the next research item on the spreadsheet.
																				
Management Process: 									
Management will collect all the items that needs to be segregated and will open SR to Segregation Team to transfer the residual amount to the beneficiary's account. Once SR is received back from Segregation Team, Management adds the transfer EID to the spreadsheet and the SR number. The case is now ready for processing of the distribution.
						

Day 1: SR is opened to Segregation Team 
Segregation Process:	
An SR is opened and routed to Bene Claims Segregation team for processing following the path below.  Segregation SR Categories: Money Out/Beneficiary Support Services/3-Segregation
