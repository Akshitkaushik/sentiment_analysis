I have been actively working towards strengthening my automation and development skills.

Over the last few months, I have improved my expertise in Automation Anywhere, Power Automate, and REST API integration.

I have started learning Python, Gen AI, ChatGPT, and n8n to align with future industry trends.

I am also focusing on understanding document processing and cross-platform automation to support more complex workflows.

There have been no major changes in career aspirations, but I am aiming for roles with more responsibility and cross-functional exposure.

To continue progressing, I would benefit from more opportunities to work on end-to-end solution design and involvement in technical decision-making.

Support in the form of training sessions, technical mentorship, and access to sandbox environments would help me grow further.
