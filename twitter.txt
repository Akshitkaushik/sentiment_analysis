 saw your email regarding the Cirrus login issue. I just wanted to update you that the issue has been resolved for the SAAP221 bot ID — I was able to log in to the Cirrus application successfully.

However, for the SAAP222 bot ID, I am encountering a different issue. I have attached the screenshot for your reference. This is not related to the previous issue or access rights — it appears that JavaScript needs to be enabled on this VDI. Once that's done, I will verify and confirm whether I can log in successfully with SAAP222 as well.
