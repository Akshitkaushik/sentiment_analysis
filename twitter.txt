Request for Review and Approval – Updated PSC Email Template

Hi Cheryl,

I hope you're doing well.

I recently received an enhancement request regarding the PSC email template. I’ve completed the necessary changes and attached the updated email template for your review. For reference, I’ve also included the original requirement email shared by Rob.

Kindly review both templates and let me know if any additional changes are needed. Please verify that all links, fonts, and formatting are correct.

If everything looks good, I would appreciate your approval so I can proceed with moving the changes to the production environment.

Thank you, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
