I would like to suggest a streamlined approach using Power Automate to manage form submissions and daily file handling efficiently.

Currently, when a user fills out and submits the form, their details are automatically added as a new row in the Excel file â€” this is already handled via Power Automate.

To further enhance this process, here's what we propose:

Daily File Creation: Power Automate will create a new Excel file every day in a SharePoint folder. This file will store all the form submissions received on that specific day.

Automated File Sharing: Once the file is populated with the day's data, Power Automate will automatically send it to our team for further processing.

Data Review & Status Update: We will review the data, perform our necessary steps, and update each entry with a "Status" column as required.

Return & Upload: After processing, we will return the updated file to you. You can then upload it to a separate SharePoint folder for record-keeping or further actions.

This approach ensures:

Organized data management on a day-to-day basis

Clear tracking of processing status

Reduced manual effort through automation
