I have completed the requested changes to the template. Please find the updated version attached.

I have made the modifications exactly as per the requirements you shared. Kindly review it and let me know if any further adjustments are needed.

Looking forward to your feedback.



The first run of the MTR bot has been successfully completed. I believe everyone should have received the success email along with the audit file.

Kindly review the audit files and verify the status. The bot has processed and unenrolled the individual IDs it identified from the database based on the input data.

Please share your feedback after reviewing the output. Once we have confirmation, I will schedule this bot to run automatically at a fixed time for future executions.

Thank you for your support.
