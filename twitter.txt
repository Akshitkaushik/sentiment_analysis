Hi Tom,

I hope you're doing well.

I would like to clarify that the MTR bot operates solely through APIs and does not interact with any user interface elements.

However, when utilizing RPA bots, we have the capability to interact directly with user interfaces, including applications like Empower Oracle Forms. RPA bots can simulate user actions such as clicking buttons, entering data, and navigating through forms, effectively automating tasks that would typically require manual input.â€‹

Rob, could you please provide further explanation or confirmation regarding the Empower Forms interaction? Your insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.
