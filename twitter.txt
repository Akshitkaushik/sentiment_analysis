Hi Khan,

I believe this might still be a record issue, although I’m not entirely sure. We can validate it together to confirm.

Could you please set up a quick call with me today at any convenient time? During the call, we can go through the issue, as the error message shows:

“No account to enroll were provided for the user” – This typically means that the bot didn’t receive any valid account details to process for enrollment, possibly due to missing or incorrect input data.

Looking forward to your availability so we can resolve this.

Best regards,
